# To Do

This is a simple To Do application which is allowed to store tasks by categories.
The API side was built on Express Framework using modules architecture.
The mongo data is stored in [mlab](https://mlab.com/) sandbox.
The remind functionality (implemented only on API side for now) is working with using [agenda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agenda). 
Also was used the fake SMTP server [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for keeping remind emails there.

## Run

Run `npm start` from root wil start both client and API.
